# Reduced backup lock time

--8<--- "pro-build-announcement.md"

!!! important

    The `--lock-ddl=REDUCED` option is a [tech preview](./glossary.md#tech-preview). Before using this option in production, we recommend that you test restoring production from physical backups in your environment, and also use the alternative backup method for redundancy.

[Percona XtraBackup 8.4.0-2](./release-notes/8.4.0-2.md) adds the [`--lock-ddl=REDUCED`](./xtrabackup-option-reference.md#lock-ddl) option to reduce the time the server remains locked by `xtrabackup` during full and incremental backups. Now, you can execute `Data Definition Language` (DDL) operations while the backup is in progress.

### Benefits

The `--lock-ddl=REDUCED` option features are as follows:

* Acquire and release the backup lock quickly: The backup process minimizes the time it holds the backup lock, allowing for concurrent DDL operations.
* Track changes with redo logs: Redo logs record all file-level changes, ensuring data consistency during the backup process.
* Handle DDL operations: The backup process generates metadata files to account for any DDL operations that occur while the backup is in progress.
* Ensure consistency: The `--prepare` step processes generated metadata files and uses redo and undo logs to create a consistent database state.

### Limitations

* Certain DDL operations consume significant resources, and xtrabackup simultaneously requires I/O to copy and read files. This requirement can increase resource demand from DDL operations during the backup process.

* The master key rotation with the `ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY` is prohibited while backup is in progress.

* Backups may be larger because new `DDL` operations are executed concurrently on the server, and the files generated by the server are included in the backup. Additionally, certain `DDL` operations, such as `ADD INDEX` or encryption changes to existing data files, will cause the data files to be recopied, increasing the backup size.

* The number of open file handles in your operating system should be configured to match the number of files in the server data directory.

* Taking a backup using [page tracking](./page-tracking.md) is not supported with `--lock-ddl=REDUCED` option.

## How the `--lock-ddl=REDUCED` option works

Percona Server for MySQL implemented `LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP` to block `DDL` operations on a server. `xtrabackup` utilizes this lock during the backup process to ensure that any `DDL` operation does not corrupt the backup. With MySQL-compatible servers `xtrabackup` utilizes `LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP` to lock the server during the backup. The lock does not affect the `Data Manipulation Language` (DML) operations. By default, `xtrabackup` enables the [`--lock-ddl=ON`](./xtrabackup-option-reference.md#lock-ddl) option to apply the backup lock at the start of the backup.

Taking backup with the `--lock-ddl=REDUCED` option includes the following phases:

### Phase 1: Operations performed without the lock

!!! warning

    Do not execute the `ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE MASTER KEY` command during `Phase 1` if there are encrypted tables. This prevents backup failures.

The following operations are performed without the lock:
{ .power-number }

1. Parse and copy the redo logs from the checkpoint up to the current `LSN`, and start tracking new file operations.
2. Start the redo log thread to copy the redo logs. 
3. Track file operations by parsing the `MLOG_FILE_*` records from the redo log. These records help track changes in the files being backed up to ensure consistency.
4. Copy the `.ibd` files.

### Phase 2: Operations performed under the lock

The following operations are performed under the lock:
{ .power-number }

1. Take the backup lock on the server to prevent new DDL operations, such as creating or altering tables.
2. Copy `non-InnoDB` files.
3. Check the file operations that were tracked and recopy the tablespaces.
4. Create additional `metadata` files to perform the required actions (deletions or renames) on the already copied files. This approach ensures that the backup remains consistent and accurate without disrupting the streaming process. This is particularly important for streaming backups.
5. Gather a sync point from all engines (InnoDB LSN, binlog, GTID, etc.) by querying the `log_status`.
6. Stop the redo thread once it copies at least up to sync point at step 4.
7. Release the backup lock on the server.

??? note "The list of metadata files"

    | File         | Description                                                                                                      |
    |--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `.new`       | For new files that are created while the backup in progress and for files that need to be recopied due to encryption or `ADD INDEX` operations.                                  |
    | `.del`       | For deleted files. For a file that has been copied by backup but deleted while the backup is in progress, create a `space_id.del` file.                                      |
    | `.ren`       | For a file that has been copied but renamed while the backup is in progress, create a space_id.ren file. This file should contain the new file name.                                                  |
    | `.crpt`      | For files that cannot be fully copied due to encryption changes. These files will be recopied, and a `.crpt` file will be created for the existing file. |
    | `.new.meta`  | Similar to `.new`, but for incremental backups.                                                                  |
    | `.new.delta` | Similar to `.new`, but for incremental backups. Create `t1.ibd.meta` and `t1.ibd.delta` instead of `t1.ibd`.      |

### Phase 3. Handling new metadata files in `--prepare`

The following operations are performed to ensure data remains intact and consistent:
{ .power-number }

1. Remove the `.crpt` files that match the name after stripping the extension. This step is crucial before the `IBD` scan because these files are incomplete (they can be zero size).
2. Perform a scan to create a mapping of `space_id` to file names.
3. Delete the file matching the `space_id` using `space_id.del`. In case of incremental backups, also delete the corresponding `.new.meta` and `.new.delta` files.
4. Rename the file matching the `space_id` to the name specified in the file using `space_id.ren`.
5. Replace the file that matches the name without the `.new` extension using the `.new` extension.
6. Replace the `meta` and `delta` files that match the name without the `.new` in the name using `.new.meta` and `.new.delta`.

After `Phase 3` is completed, the regular [crash recovery](./how-xtrabackup-works.md) starts.
